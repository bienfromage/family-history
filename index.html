    <h4>Why do Latter-day Saints Care So Much about Family History?</h4>
    <p>First, Latter-day Saints believe that having an understanding of where they came from and who they are related to helps to strengthen personal virtue and fosters bonding amongst living family members. Second, Latter-day Saints believe that we can help ancestors who have passed on without choosing to follow Christ to have the opportunity to accept Him in the hereafter. For example, ancestors who never had the chance to learn about Christ are still able to receive the blessings of heaven through baptism if their descendants do certian things on the earth to help them obtain those blessings. ("About Family History").</p>
    <p>Some of those things include special religious ceremonies which member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints perform in temples on behalf of their ancestors ("Baptisms for the Dead").</p>

    <h4>Does family history work appear in the Bible?</h4>
    <p>Yes! Both the practice of recording genealogy and the Latter-day Saint practice of holding “proxy baptisms” for one’s ancestors appear in the Bible.</p><br>
    <p>Throughout the first five books of the Bible, we see many genealogical lists of the early Israelites and their descendants. (See, for example, Genesis chapter 10). Additionally, prophecies about the importance of family history feature in the Book of Malachi:</p><br>
    <p>&emsp; Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:</p>
    <p>&emsp; And he shall <i>turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers,</i> lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. (Malachi 4:5-6)</p><br>
    <p>Latter-day Saints believe these verses to refer specifically to the practice of researching one’s ancestry, and of performing ceremonies like proxy baptisms for one’s ancestors.</p><br>
    <p>The proxy baptism ceremony itself also appears in the Bible. The Apostle Paul briefly references it in his letter to the Corinthians:</p><br>
    <p>&emsp; Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? (1 Corinthians 15:29)</p><br>
    <p>Many biblical scholars from outside the Latter-day Saint faith have struggled to find a meaningful interpretation of this verse. It is hard to understand exactly what Paul is referring to without the context of revelations from modern prophets on the subject of proxy baptism (see Where do temple ceremonies come from?). However, most have decided that this verse describes a Corinthian practice involving “a vicarious baptism undergone by the living for the benefit of the dead.” (DeMaris).</p>

    <h4>Will I see my ancestors and family members in Heaven, even if they were not Christians?</h4>
    <p>Although the final judgement of who is worthy to abide with God in heaven rests with God Himself, it is certain that even ancestors who never had the chance to know about Christ or chose not to accept Him in life will have the opportunity to do so in the hereafter.</p><br>
    <p>In modern times, it is possible for deceased ancestors to receive the blessings of following Christ in sanctified, holy places called “temples” through special ceremonies called “ordinances” ("Why Ordinances and Covenants Matter").</p><br>
    <p>The New Testament declares that in ancient times early Christians also practiced these ceremonies and believed that their dead could be redeemed through Christ (1 Corinthians 15:29, Paulsen).</p>

    <h4>What are temples and where do they come from?</h4>
    <p>Throughout history, the Lord has commanded His people to build temples. In the Old Testament, we read that the Lord commanded His prophet Moses to make a type of mobile temple called a tabernacle (Exodus 25:8). Later, Solomon the King of Israel constructed a temple similar in function and shape to the tabernacle (1 Chronicles 22:6). In His time on the earth, Jesus Himself frequently went to the temple to teach (Luke 2:46, Mark 12:35). In the mid 1800’s, the Lord once again commanded His people to build a temple to receive the same blessings as the ancient followers of Christ therein (D&C 88:109-112).</p>
    <p>Within the temple, Latter-day Saints hold special religious ceremonies to help themselves feel closer to God, similar to the sacraments performed in many Christian sects. Additionally, Latter-day Saints perform some special "proxy ordinances" in the temple: special ceremonies in which a living Latter-day Saint stands in as a "proxy" for a deceased ancestor so that the ancestor may receive the blessings of God they may not have had the opportunity to receive them in this life. Latter-day Saints believe that with the performance of these ceremonies their ancestors have the opportunity to choose to accept Christ, although they are not forced to do so.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, Latter-day Saints may refer to these ceremonies as "ordinances for the dead." ("Baptisms for the Dead").</p>

    <h4>Where do temple ceremonies come from?</h4>
    <p>The sacred ceremonies performed in temples were sent by God to His modern prophets on the earth. The first recorded instance of the performance of a temple ceremony in modern history comes from Jane Neyman in August of 1840. In a sermon on the 15th of that month, the prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day-Saints explained that with authority from God a follower of Christ could be baptized in behalf of his or her unbaptized ancestors, serving as a proxy so that they could “inherit the kingdom of God” even though they were not baptized in life (John 3:5, Baker). Soon after the sermon, Jane Neyman was baptized on behalf of her deceased son in a nearby river (Neyman). More “baptisms for the dead” or “proxy baptisms” as they came to be called occurred throughout the following weeks. Letters from this time period show that the Lord revealed more about the specifics of proxy baptisms over time stipulating, for example, that they should be recorded by the church and that future proxy baptisms should take place only in the temple (Joseph Papers, Saints, Bishop).</p><br>
    <p>The Lord did not restrict the blessing of being baptized on behalf of one’s ancestors only to modern Christians. It is clear from the Bible and from many early Christian texts that baptisms for the dead existed in New Testament times as well (Paulsen).</p>
